								(CSS CODE)


Basically in this code we have both the html as well as css code . This is basically to seperate the html i.e HTML is a markup language used to create static web pages and web applications. CSS is a style sheet language responsible for the presentation of documents written in a markup language.

so in order to sync both the lang codes , we have to link both the coding langs via 
		------  <linK rel="stylesheet" href=" THE SOURCE PATH "> 

Firstly ----

1 . we will use h2 tag and will be giving it rgb color where rgb stands for red green blue and the 4th row (r,g,b,a) , here "a" means the opacity of the 	color , i.e strength of the color's . We can use color picker for picking the color of so .

2 . we will give button a color , i.e the font color , and here bg color means the background color of the button , and will give it a font family.

3 . here ".click" means the -class- (click) and #one means the id of that paragraph or any other tag with which that id is attached.
