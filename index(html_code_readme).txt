Basically in this code we have both the html as well as css code . This is basically to seperate the html i.e HTML is a markup language used to create static web pages and web applications. CSS is a style sheet language responsible for the presentation of documents written in a markup language.

so in order to sync both the lang codes , we have to link both the coding langs via 
		------  <linK rel="stylesheet" href=" THE SOURCE PATH "> 

Firstly in the body part , we will -------- 

1 . give the heading ,  a darkblue color , where the color is to color 	the text via style tag in the specific Heading tag.

2. We will not use heading tags like <H1> , <H2> just for the size , it is used for priority , i.e h1 tag will be of more 		priority and will look more heavier , we will not use them for size purpose ,, for size , we will use different tag.

3 . similarly few more heading tags , will paragraph tags with unique id's which will be used in more detail in the CSS part / 	file i have uploaded .
 	
4 . we have used <hr> tag , which basically stands for horizontal ruler, which acts as a horizontal line btw the paragraphs or 	the content are , typically body . This tag can also be of difft style and color . 

		⭕ border-top: 1px dashed red;
		⭕ border-radius: 5px; -- which we will learn later on.

5 . we will be providing a button which will be clickable and we will anchor a link to it with target="-main" in order to surf to 	a new tab via that link , or else the link will open in the same tab on which we are running the code . i.e live server 	one.
